\subsubsection{Scrum of Scrums}\label{Scrum of Scrums} 
During this new sprint, the team had started on focus the console and develop 
games to proof the functionality of it, so, the team had created some Product 
Requirements Documents (PRD). One for the console and the others for TicTacToe 
and Pacman Games.
At the same time, during the Lead's Daily we discuss about the new change of 
the architecture, which present a change on the previous work of TicTacToe game. 
During this time, we also discuss to use Vulkan graphic API, so we have update 
the PRD for console to put it as new requirement.
