\section{Scrum of Scrums}\label{Scrum of Scrums} 
During this 1st sprint, the team had started to define and implement the initial contract 
for the developer. So, some of the most important User Stories were 18 and 30. On the other hand, 
the team also started to prioritize User Stories 19 and 20 to complete the game execution.
All of the above User Stories mentioned had a special discussion in the Lead's Daily that
occurred on Tuesday and Thursday, due to see the approaches for the contract 
and the graphic library to be difined for the game execution needed.
