\subsection{Sprint 2}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

In this Sprint 2, we have started on the initial implementation of the bridge and design of UML for Pacman.

\subsubsection{UMLs}

At this point, we have started with our next game which was Pacman, so the we designed an UML for it

\begin{itemize}
    \item Task ID - 72: \href{https://github.com/Pending-Name-21/arquitecture/pull/11}{Pacman UML Diagram on GitHub}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Spikes}

There were no Spikes

\subsubsection{POCs}

In this Sprint, we had no Proofs of Concept (POCs).

\subsubsection{Technical Justification}

During Sprint 2, the team focused on designing UMLs of the games
and start on the initial phase of the brigde. This decision was based on the following reasons:

\subsubsection{High - Level Architecture}

The architecture followed in this sprint was based on the initial architecture.

\subsubsection{Conclusions}

In Sprint 2, we started to work on the basics but unfortunately 
we could not finish so the user stories were moved to carry over 
but they helped us to see the beginning of the work ahead of us.
